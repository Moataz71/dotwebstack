# Documentation guidelines

- User-oriented documentation is maintained in the dotwebstack.io repository;
- General development documentation is placed in the `docs` directory of the dotwebstack repository;
- Specific development documentation is placed in the `docs` directory of the appropriated repository;
- Documentation should be made as MarkDown, unless this is not practical (like javadoc).
